            -> Server ---------> Main Gamemode settings.
                             |-> Variables, and main functions.
                             
                             |-> Ban System, Admin Functions.
            -> Administration -> Administrator commands.
                             |-> 15 Admin Level systems.
            
                             |-> BattleRoyal (Fortnite mode)
